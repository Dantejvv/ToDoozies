# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
ToDoozies is an iOS todo application built with SwiftUI, SwiftData, and modern iOS frameworks. The app is designed to support both regular tasks and recurring habits with streak tracking and visualization.

# - iPad (A16), iPad Air 11-inch (M3), iPad Pro 11-inch (M4), iPad mini (A17 Pro)
```

### Testing Framework
- Uses Swift Testing framework (not XCTest)
- Test files use `@Test` attributes and `#expect(...)` assertions
- **IMPORTANT**: Tests that use SwiftData ModelContext require `@MainActor` annotation
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: 70+ test methods across all models
- **Test Data Factories**: Complete factory pattern for reliable test data
- **CRUD Testing**: Full Create/Read/Update/Delete operation coverage
- **Relationship Testing**: Bidirectional and cascade relationship verification
- **Async Testing**: Modern async/await patterns with proper isolation
- **Main Actor Isolation**: For SwiftData compatibility
- Unit tests: `ToDooziesTests/ToDooziesTests.swift`
- UI tests: `ToDooziesUITests/ToDooziesUITests.swift`

## Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **SwiftUI**: Declarative UI framework
- **SwiftData**: Core Data successor for data persistence
- **CloudKit**: Enabled for automatic cross-device sync
- **Swift Testing**: Modern testing framework
- **Model-View (MV)**: Architecture pattern

### Task & Habit Type System (September 2025)

#### **Task Types**

**1. One-Time Tasks**
- **Definition**: Single-occurrence tasks with a specific due date/time
- **Examples**: "Buy groceries", "Call doctor", "Submit report by Friday 5pm"
- **Characteristics**:
  - Has a due date (optional time)
  - Completed once and disappears from active list
  - Can be overdue
  - No repetition pattern
  - Task-focused (getting things done)
- **Data Model**: Single `Task` entity
- **Shown in**: Tasks tab, TodayView (if due today), Calendar view

**2. Recurring Tasks**
- **Definition**: Tasks that repeat on a schedule but are task-oriented (not habit-building)
- **Examples**: "Take out garbage cans every Thursday", "Pay rent on 1st of month", "Weekly team meeting every Monday 2pm"
- **Characteristics**:
  - Has a recurrence pattern (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)
  - Each occurrence is a separate task instance
  - Can be completed individually per occurrence
  - Can be overdue if missed
  - Task-focused (getting things done, not building habits)
  - Has specific due dates/times
- **Data Model**: Base `Task` + `RecurrenceRule` → generates task instances
- **Shown in**: Tasks tab, TodayView (today's occurrence), Calendar view

**3. Habits**
- **Definition**: Repeated activities focused on building consistency and streaks
- **Examples**: "Take medication daily", "Go to gym (Tues, Wed, Fri, Sat)", "Read for 30 mins daily", "Drink 8 glasses water"
- **Characteristics**:
  - Has a recurrence pattern (daily, weekly schedule, etc.)
  - Streak tracking (current streak, best streak)
  - Protection days for maintaining streaks
  - Habit-focused (building consistency and long-term behavior)
  - No specific "due time" - just daily occurrence pattern
  - Completion resets daily for tracking consistency
- **Data Model**: `Task` + `Habit` entity + `RecurrenceRule` → streak tracking
- **Shown in**: Habits tab, TodayView (today's habits), Calendar heatmap view

#### **App Organization & Relationships**

**Task Creation Screen**:
- **Current**: `[Regular Task] [Recurring Habit]` toggle (2 options)
- **New Design**: Three-option picker:
  - `[One-Time Task]` - Single occurrence with due date
  - `[Recurring Task]` - Repeating task instances with schedule
  - `[Habit]` - Streak-building activity with consistency focus

**Tab Organization**:
1. **Today Tab** (read-only): Shows all three types for today's date
2. **Tasks Tab**: One-time tasks + recurring task instances (task-focused)
3. **Habits Tab**: Only habits with streak tracking and consistency metrics
4. **Calendar Tab**: All types with different visualizations (tasks vs habit heatmaps)

**Data Relationships**:
- **One-Time Tasks**: Single `Task` entity with due date
- **Recurring Tasks**: Base `Task` + `RecurrenceRule` → generates individual task instances over time
- **Habits**: `Task` + `Habit` entity + `RecurrenceRule` → enables streak tracking and consistency metrics

**Key Behavioral Differences**:
- **Recurring Tasks**: Focus on completion of individual scheduled instances (like appointments)
- **Habits**: Focus on building streaks and maintaining daily/weekly consistency patterns
- **UI Treatment**: Different icons, completion styles, progress indicators, and tracking metrics
- **Recurrence System**: Shared underlying `RecurrenceRule` system but different presentation and tracking focus

#### **Implementation Status**
- **Current State**: Basic recurring habits implemented (✅)
- **Target State**: Three distinct task/habit types with appropriate UI/UX differentiation (🚧 PLANNED)

### Data Model
- Uses SwiftData with `@Model` classes integrated with CloudKit
- **Core Models**: Task, RecurrenceRule, Habit, Category, Subtask, Attachment
- **Relationships**: Proper cascade/nullify delete rules configured
- **Business Logic**: Streak tracking and visualization, recurrence patterns, progress calculation
- `ModelContainer` configured in `ToDooziesApp.swift` with CloudKit sync and shared app group
- Supports both local storage and automatic iCloud sync via private CloudKit database
- CloudKit container: `iCloud.dante.ToDoozies`
- App group: `group.dante.ToDoozies` for widget data sharing

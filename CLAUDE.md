# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
ToDoozies is an iOS todo application built with SwiftUI, SwiftData, and modern iOS frameworks. The app is designed to support both regular tasks and recurring habits with streak tracking.

## Development Commands

### Building and Running
```bash
# Build the project
xcodebuild -project ToDoozies.xcodeproj -scheme ToDoozies build -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16'

# Run unit tests
xcodebuild test -project ToDoozies.xcodeproj -scheme ToDoozies -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16'

# Run UI tests
xcodebuild test -project ToDoozies.xcodeproj -scheme ToDoozies -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' -only-testing:ToDooziesUITests

# Available simulator destinations (iOS 18.6):
# - iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, iPhone 16 Pro Max
# - iPad (A16), iPad Air 11-inch (M3), iPad Pro 11-inch (M4), iPad mini (A17 Pro)
```

### Testing Framework
- Uses Swift Testing framework (not XCTest)
- Test files use `@Test` attributes and `#expect(...)` assertions
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: 70+ test methods across all models
- **Test Data Factories**: Complete factory pattern for reliable test data
- **CRUD Testing**: Full Create/Read/Update/Delete operation coverage
- **Relationship Testing**: Bidirectional and cascade relationship verification
- **Async Testing**: Modern async/await patterns with proper isolation
- Unit tests: `ToDooziesTests/ToDooziesTests.swift`
- UI tests: `ToDooziesUITests/ToDooziesUITests.swift`

## Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **SwiftUI**: Declarative UI framework
- **SwiftData**: Core Data successor for data persistence
- **CloudKit**: Enabled for automatic cross-device sync
- **Swift Testing**: Modern testing framework
- **Model-View (MV)**: Architecture pattern

### Data Model
- Uses SwiftData with `@Model` classes integrated with CloudKit
- **Core Models**: Task, RecurrenceRule, Habit, Category, Subtask, Attachment
- **Relationships**: Proper cascade/nullify delete rules configured
- **Business Logic**: Streak tracking, recurrence patterns, progress calculation
- `ModelContainer` configured in `ToDooziesApp.swift` with CloudKit sync and shared app group
- Supports both local storage and automatic iCloud sync via private CloudKit database
- CloudKit container: `iCloud.dante.ToDoozies`
- App group: `group.dante.ToDoozies` for widget data sharing
